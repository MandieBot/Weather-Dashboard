# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This browser application features a current-day and five-day weather forecast that pulls data from the OpenWeather One Call API and Geocoding API.

## Usage

When the user enters a city into the Search field form, the page displays the current day forecast with the corresponding weather icon, and also shows the present date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The five-day forecast is depicted below this current day forecast. Previous city search inputs are saved into local storage and persist in buttons on the page.
